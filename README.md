# AbsoluteSizeConverter-RobloxStudio
This simple program allows you to convert offset values into scale value for your UI Objects in your Roblox Studio game!
## How to use application
### Disclaimer: This tutorial is for Windows users ONLY!
Step 1: You must [install python](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3131/) as this is required to run this application!
Step 2: Open the command prompt by pressing WIN + R and typing `cmd` in the prompt. Then click "Run".
Step 3: Attach the directory to the python executable (NOT the value-scaling program) along with the directory of the python file like this: ` & [DIRECTORY_TO_PYTHON_EXE] [DIRECTORY_TO_PYTHON_PROGRAM]`

If the command prompt prints `Pixel scaling for Roblox Studio app by ZakDevOnGitHub`, this means you successfully ran the program! I hope this program is very useful. üëç
